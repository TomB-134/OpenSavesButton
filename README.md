# Open Saves Button
This mod adds a simple button to the singleplayer menu that upon being pressed will open the saves folder from .minecraft. Similar to the open pack folder button in resource packs.
This mod requires [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)
